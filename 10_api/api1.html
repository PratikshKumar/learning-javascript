<!-- Fetch us used in Api commands. But it is 
launched 3-4 years ago only. Before that fetch,  
API request fetching was also present. 
So how it was done.. It was done by XML HTTP request. 

XML Http Request -> XML Http RequestEventTarget -> Event Target 

XML Http Request is heavily used in AJAX programming. (Asynchonous JS and XML)

There are states of every thing in this. 

Ready State Status : 
        0 : UNSENT : Cliwnt Created but open() not called 
        1 : OPENED : open() has called 
        2 : Headers Received 
        3 : Loading 
        4 : DONE
